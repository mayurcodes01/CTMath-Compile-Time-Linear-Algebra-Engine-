# CTMath-Compile-Time-Linear-Algebra-Engine-
CTMath is a header-only C++ compile-time linear algebra engine that enforces matrix dimensional correctness at compile time using templates and static assertions. It eliminates runtime safety checks while delivering zero-cost abstractions and high performance. The project demonstrates advanced C++ concepts such as compile-time programming,etc
